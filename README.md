###Facility AI v2

Old Facility AI was wack, this one brings it back.

Now time for a haiku:

Why do we need this
Because it can be quite fun
if it is done right

So yeah I'm just gonna copy a bunch of stuff from the dead FacalityAI (RIP)
And I'm gonna make some improvements because I know more python than I used to
And if anyone wants to help that's cool too, make a branch and get to work boi

Lets bring this baby back to life
